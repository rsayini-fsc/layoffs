select year(`date`) as years, sum(total_laid_off) as sum_layoffs
from layoffs_staging2
group by years
order by sum_layoffs desc;

  b. month wise total layoffs

select monthname(`date`) as months, sum(total_laid_off) as sum_layoffs
from layoffs_staging2
group by months
order by sum_layoffs desc;

, monthname(`date`) as months, sum(total_laid_off) as sum_layoffs,
lag(sum(total_laid_off)) over (order by year(`date`),month (`date`)) as previous_month,
sum(total_laid_off) - lag(sum(total_laid_off)) over (order by year(`date`), month (`date`)) as month_to_month_change

group by company,years
order by years asc, ranking asc)

select * from cte where ranking <=3; # gives top 3 companies each year which had maixmum layoffs 

e. companies with 100% layoffs

where percentage_laid_off =1;

select count(*) from layoffs_staging2
where percentage_laid_off =1;

f. comapnies with largest employee loss when layoffs were 100%

select * from layoffs_staging2
where percentage_laid_off =1
order by total_laid_off desc;

g. worst affected countries by layoffs each year (ranking)
